# OKT3-Antibody-Humanization
Wet lab protocol for transplant immunology using AHG-CDC assay
# Humanization of Anti-CD3 Antibody Using Protein Language Models

This project was undertaken during my M.Sc. Virology dissertation at Jamia Millia Islamia. The aim was to reduce the immunogenicity of murine OKT3 monoclonal antibody by computational humanization using protein language models.

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques Used
- MODELLER: Homology modeling of antibody structures
- AbRSA: Identification of CDR regions
- BIOPHI + SAPIENS: Protein language models for antibody humanization
- PyMOL: Visualization and binding interface mapping
- AMBER: Molecular Dynamics Simulations (200–300 ns)
- CPPTRAJ: Post-MD analysis (RMSD, RMSF, hydrogen bonds)

## 📊 Key Analyses
- DOPE score and Ramachandran plot validation
- MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA free energy calculations
- Binding energy mapping per residue

## 💡 Outcome
The humanized OKT3 showed reduced binding energy (-51 kcal/mol) compared to murine OKT3 (-66 kcal/mol), while retaining potential efficacy for therapeutic applications.
